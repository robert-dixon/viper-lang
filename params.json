{"name":"Viper","tagline":"a clean and simple programming language","body":"### Why Viper?\r\nViper is just another programming language.  I didn't build it to solve some great unsolved programming problems - I built it because I wanted to build a language and this one is just the way I like it.  Therefore, my personal taste and preference has been one of the main decisions in designing the language, and I like clean simple stuff.  If this language just so happens to be your taste too, well then please join in!\r\n\r\nI like being able to knock together proof-of-concept programs quickly and easily, and that's really what viper is designed for - for using at hackathons and the like, not for designing large serious systems. (But maybe one day...)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### How Viper?\r\nA set of tutorials will be published when I've got a little further with development.  For now, to install on your machine, download\r\n\r\n<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robert-dixon/viper-lang/master/viper-install.sh>\r\n\r\nand execute the following commands:\r\n\r\n    chmod +x ./viper-install.sh\r\n    . ./viper-install.sh\r\n\r\n(Watch out - that first . is important, y'know)\r\n\r\nYou'll need code to look pretty while you're using Viper.  If you use sublime, download\r\n\r\n<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robert-dixon/viper-lang/master/viper.tmLanguage>\r\n\r\nAnd place it in your packages folder.\r\n\r\nYou're good to go!  To use viper, the command syntax is as follows\r\n\r\n    viper /path/to/source_file.vpr -o /path/to/output_executable\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Who Viper?\r\nWell, since you ask, I am @robert-dixon, I'm a Computer Science student at the University of St Andrews and I like languages - programming languages and natural languages.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
