<p>Viper is just another programming language.  I didn't build it to solve some great unsolved programming problems - I built it because I wanted to build a language and this one is just the way I like it.  Therefore, my personal taste and preference has been one of the main decisions in designing the language, and I like clean simple stuff.  If this language just so happens to be your taste too, well then please join in!</p>

<p>I like being able to knock together proof-of-concept programs quickly and easily, and that's really what viper is designed for - for using at hackathons and the like, not for designing large serious systems. (But maybe one day...)</p>

<a id="how-viper" class="anchor" href="#how-viper" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How Viper?</h3>

<p>A set of tutorials will be published when I've got a little further with development.  For now, to install on your machine, download</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robert-dixon/viper-lang/master/viper-install.sh">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robert-dixon/viper-lang/master/viper-install.sh</a></p>

<p>and execute the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>chmod +x ./viper-install.sh
. ./viper-install.sh
</code></pre>

<p>(Watch out - that first . is important, y'know)</p>

<p>You'll need code to look pretty while you're using Viper.  If you use sublime, download</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robert-dixon/viper-lang/master/viper.tmLanguage">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robert-dixon/viper-lang/master/viper.tmLanguage</a></p>

<p>And place it in your packages folder.</p>

<a id="who-viper" class="anchor" href="#who-viper" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who Viper?</h3>

<p>Well, since you ask, I am <a href="https://github.com/robert-dixon" class="user-mention">@robert-dixon</a>, I'm a Computer Science student at the University of St Andrews and I like languages - programming languages and natural languages.</p>
