Thanks for wanting to work on viper!
====================================

To start playing with the code:
	- Set your PATH environment variable to include the 'build' directory
	of this respository	by executing the following command
	
		export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/repository/build
	
	You may want to add this command to your ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile
	or ~/.bashrc file to make the change permanent.  Make sure to get rid
	of references to any other installation while you're there.

	- Create a new environment variable called VPRDIR, set to the build
	directory

		export VPRDIR=/path/to/repository/build

	As before, this is made persistant by adding it to your bash profile
	script (wherever that is on your flavour of unix).

	-Run the 'make' command in this directory to compile the binary.

That's it you're goood to go!
